# Solution #1 - Brute Force
- Calculate difference between current day price with every upcoming day and calculate the profit
- Time complexity - O(n^2)
```python
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
profit = 0
l = len(prices)
for i in range(l):
    buy = prices[i]
    for j in range(i+1, l):
        if (prices[j] - buy) > profit:
            profit = prices[j] - buy
print(profit)
```

# Solution #2 - Optimize the no. of comparison
- Keep a track of least buying price so that we can skip the prices higher than least price
- We can reduce the no. of comparison but still as we have nested loops time complexity will be same
- Time complexity - O(n^2)
```python
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
profit = 0
l = len(prices)
least_buy = prices[0]
for i in range(l):
    buy = prices[i]
    if buy <= least_buy:
        least_buy = buy
    else:
        continue
    for j in range(i+1, l):
        if (prices[j] - buy) > profit:
            profit = prices[j] - buy
print(profit)
```

# Solution #3 - Optimized solution
- Keep track of minimum price as we traverse the array/list
- As there are no nested loops there will be max n comparisons
- Time complexity - O(n)
```python
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
profit = 0
minimum = prices[0]
for i in prices[1:]:
    if i < minimum:
        minimum = i
    if i - minimum > profit:
        profit = i - minimum
print(profit)
```
